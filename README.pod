=head1 Excellent

Excellent - Haskell module for calculating Excellent numbers

=head2 Synopsis

  import Excellent

  print $ filter intExcellent [1..100000]

=head2 Description

F<Excellent.hs> exports a boolean function called C<intExcellent> which checks for Excellent numbers.

An excellent number is any even digits-length integer where the difference between its two halves squared equals the original integer.

For example, 48 is excellent:

  48 = abs(4^2 - 8^2)

So is 3468:

  3468 = abs(34^2 - 68^2)

And so on.

=head2 Compiling

Excellent comes with F<main.hs> which will run forever, printing Excellent numbers to the command line.

  ghc -O2 main.hs
  ./main
